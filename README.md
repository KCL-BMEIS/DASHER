Dasher was developed by the [School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis) at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk), in collaboration with the [Centre for Medical Image Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) and [RTTQA](https://twitter.com/rttqa_uk?lang=en). This project received funding from RTTQA (NIHR funded). The development of this tool was also supported by the [Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Medical Engineering](https://medicalengineering.org.uk) [WT 203148/Z/16/Z, NS/A000049/1], ART-NET (Cancer Research UK Advanced Radiotherapy Technologies Network) [A219932], STFC Global Challenge Network+ in Advanced Radiotherapy (ST/N002423/1) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) [Biomedical Research Centre based at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London](https://www.guysandstthomasbrc.nihr.ac.uk).

We are grateful to all the testing sites that provided feedback during the project development.
